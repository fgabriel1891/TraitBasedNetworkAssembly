## **Background information on the network assembly simulations**

Simulation parameters for all scenarios tested of bipartite network assembly can be found as a Table in Supplementary Material S1. 
The functions to replicate the assembly scenarios can also run in parallel. To replicate the full scenario list, we recomend running the scripts in a computer cluster. 


## **Background information about the plant–frugivore interaction data used in the case study**


The data are provided as an RData file (named “dataSet1.RData”)
that contains a list (named “dataSet1”) of three data frames:
(1) pT (plant traits), (2) aT (animal traits), and
(3) N (data on pairwise plant–animal interactions across six study sites to construct the plant–frugivore networks).

The metadata describing the information contained in each of these data frames is provided in Tables 1, 2 and 3 in of **metaData_20210312** file
